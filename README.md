# Zephyr Nights Theme for VSCode

A **Visual Studio Code** color theme made based in pure personal taste for coding at nights, and why not, all day too!

I made this theme because I found several themes that I liked a lot, but none of them _catched_ me to stick to it, so I decided to make mine!

## Misc

This is the first theme I've done, so I'm basically looking for any feedback I can get.
